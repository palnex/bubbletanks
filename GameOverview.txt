Specification for the game Bubble Tanks


—----------—----------Main idea—----------—----------



Bubble Tanks is a single-player shooter mobile game where the player controls the tank, fighting off the hordes of enemy tanks. While doing so, the player collects upgrades from defeated enemies. In the menu, players can attach acquired upgrades to create stronger tanks with various playstyles.



—----------—----------What is a tank?—----------—----------



A tank is the primary unit used by both enemies and player to create interaction between the two.

Here is the list of things a tank has:

* Core
	-> A core is the "heart" of the tank, so there's no tank without a core
	-> To destroy a tank, the core must be destroyed, meaning the core has health
	-> All upgrades are attached around the core
	-> A core could be upgraded in simple level system though various tasks or currency, permanently increasing attibutes such as 
		* health of the tank
		* the amount of upgrade slots
	-> Each core has a default gun which could only be destroyed alongside with core, so that a tank can defend themselves even if all upgrades are destroyed

* Upgrades
	-> Player starts with no upgrades
	-> Player is able to buy new upgrades in the shop using "soap" currenty
	-> All of the available upgrades are stored in the player's inventory in the main menu permanently after acquisition
	-> Tanks are able to be equiped upgrading slots (more on them later)
	   * Shields (defense)
	   * Guns (offense)
	   * Generator (support)
	-> In order to apply the effects of the upgrade, an upgrade has to be physically attached from the player's inventory to available tank slots
	-> Each upgrade has their own health, if the upgrade is destroyed during the match and their benefits are faided away during the match away, but the upgrades would still be present in the inventory in their original form
